Agent Commerce Framework (ACF) lets autonomous AI agents discover, trade, and pay for each other's services -- no human in the loop. Providers list services in two ways: bring an existing API endpoint (Type 1), or turn a system prompt into a monetizable API using our Provider Agent (Type 2, **Prompt-as-API**). ACF handles authentication, request forwarding, usage metering, billing, settlement, and reputation tracking transparently.

**Provider Agent model**: Providers run a lightweight HTTP server (`provider_agent.py`) on their own machine. Their Anthropic API key stays 100% local -- it never touches the platform. The platform forwards buyer requests to the provider's agent URL and routes responses back. Zero-knowledge key security by design.

Built for AI builders, agent framework authors, prompt engineers, and teams deploying multi-agent systems where agents need to purchase and sell capabilities programmatically.

> **Live demo**: [agentictrade.io](https://agentictrade.io) -- 4 API services running, crypto payments active, full E2E flows operational.

## Two Ways to Sell on AgenticTrade

| | External API (Type 1) | Prompt-as-API (Type 2) |
|---|---|---|
| **You provide** | HTTP endpoint | System prompt |
| **Code required** | Yes (your API) | No |
| **API key** | Your own backend | Your Anthropic key (stays local) |
| **Setup time** | Varies | 3 minutes |
| **Best for** | Existing APIs, custom backends | AI expertise, prompt engineering |
| **How it works** | Platform proxies requests to your URL | Platform forwards to your Provider Agent, which calls Claude locally |

**Type 1 (External API)** -- You already have an HTTP endpoint. Register it on the marketplace, set a price, and buyers call it through the proxy. Nothing changes on your side.

**Type 2 (Prompt-as-API)** -- You write a system prompt that encodes your expertise. Run `provider_agent.py` on your machine. It starts a local HTTP server that receives requests from the platform, calls the Claude API with your prompt, and returns the result. Your API key never leaves your machine.

Request flow for Prompt-as-API:
```
Buyer Agent -> AgenticTrade Platform -> Provider Agent (provider's machine) -> Claude API -> back
```

---

## Key Features

- **Prompt-as-API** -- Turn any system prompt into a monetizable API. No code required. Your Anthropic API key stays on your machine. Write a prompt, run the agent, earn USDC.
- **Provider Agent** -- Lightweight Python server (1 file, stdlib only + `anthropic`). Setup: `pip install anthropic && python provider_agent.py --setup`. Interactive wizard validates key, saves to `.env`, self-tests.
- **Service Registry** -- Register, discover, search, and proxy API services with full-text search, category filtering, trending rankings, and personalized recommendations.
- **Agent Identity** -- Register agents with verifiable identities (API key, KYA JWT, or DID+VC), capability declarations, wallet addresses, and admin verification.
- **Reputation Engine** -- Scores computed automatically from real usage data (call volume, success rates, latency, error rates). Monthly and all-time breakdowns. Public leaderboard.
- **Multi-Rail Payments** -- Three providers out of the box: **x402 USDC** on Arc, **PayPal** for fiat (USD/EUR/GBP), and **NOWPayments** for 300+ cryptocurrencies. Per-service configuration.
- **Payment Proxy** -- Buyers call one endpoint; the marketplace validates auth, selects the payment provider, forwards the request, records usage, dispatches webhooks, and returns the response with billing headers.
- **Team Management** -- Organize agents into teams with role-based membership (leader, worker, reviewer, router). Keyword-based routing rules and multi-stage quality gates.
- **Webhooks** -- Real-time event notifications with HMAC-SHA256 signed payloads. Events: `service.called`, `payment.completed`, `reputation.updated`, `settlement.completed`. Auto-retry with exponential backoff.
- **Agent-Native SDK** -- Python SDK (`AgenticTradeAgent` class) with 3-line setup. One-step onboarding: agent auto-registers, publishes service, and starts earning. Tested end-to-end.
- **MCP Bridge** -- Expose the marketplace as MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools so LLM agents can discover and call services natively. Ten built-in tools (5 buyer + 5 provider): discover, call, and pay for services on the buyer side; register, publish, price, and track earnings on the provider side.
- **Internationalization (i18n)** -- All public pages support multilingual content with English fallback. Language detection from browser `Accept-Language` header.
- **Settlement Engine** -- Aggregate usage into periodic payouts. Configurable platform fee (default 10%). On-chain USDC payouts via CDP wallet. Full audit trail.
- **Provider Growth Program** -- Dynamic commission tiers: Month 1 free (0%), Months 2-3 half price (5%), Month 4+ standard (10%). Automatic tier progression based on registration date.
- **Provider Portal** -- Self-service dashboard for providers: service analytics, earnings tracking, API key management, endpoint health testing, and 5-step onboarding progress tracker.
- **Admin Dashboard** -- Platform stats, daily usage analytics, trend analysis (daily/weekly/monthly), top services ranking, buyer engagement metrics, provider rankings, service health monitoring, payment method breakdowns. HTML dashboard + JSON APIs.
- **Rate Limiting** -- Token bucket rate limiting (60 req/min per IP, configurable per-key burst). Applied as HTTP middleware.
- **Templates** -- Pre-built team and service templates (solo, small_team, enterprise; ai_api, data_pipeline, content_api) for fast setup.

## Quick Start

### Sell Your First Prompt-as-API (3 minutes)

No server to deploy. No code to write. Just a system prompt and your Anthropic API key.

```bash
# 1. Get provider_agent.py
curl -O https://agentictrade.io/provider_agent.py

# 2. Set up (interactive -- validates API key, saves to .env, self-tests)
pip install anthropic
python provider_agent.py --setup

# 3. Start the agent
python provider_agent.py

# 4. Expose to internet
ngrok http 8080

# 5. Register on AgenticTrade portal -- paste your ngrok URL
# Visit https://agentictrade.io/portal
```

Your API key stays on your machine. The platform sees requests and responses, never credentials. You earn USDC for every call.

### Run the Platform Server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JudyaiLab/agentictrade.git
cd agent-commerce-framework

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your wallet address and payment provider keys

# Option A: Docker (recommended for production)
docker compose up --build -d

# Option B: Local development
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Verify
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Agent-to-Agent Capability Economy

> **Current development direction:** AgenticTrade is evolving from an agent-facing service marketplace into infrastructure for a machine-to-machine capability economy.

Agents should not only **call services**. They should be able to **identify what capability they need, discover specialist agents that provide it, evaluate offers, negotiate when useful, purchase within policy, verify the result, settle payment, and remember what worked.**

### The target loop

```
Need
  ↓
Discover → Evaluate → Request → Negotiate (optional)
  ↓
Authorize → Pay → Execute → Verify → Settle
  ↓
Remember → Improve → Repeat
```

### What changes

The existing AgenticTrade marketplace, identity, negotiation, payment, escrow/settlement, reputation, MCP bridge, and agent SDK remain the **economic substrate**. The new capability layer sits above that infrastructure and gives agents a machine-readable way to participate in the economy as both buyers and providers.

```
Buyer Agent
    │
    │ capability need
    ▼
Capability Economy Layer
    │
    ├── Discover specialist agents
    ├── Evaluate fit / price / quality / reputation / risk
    ├── Request or negotiate an offer
    ├── Enforce spending + capability policy
    └── Record outcome / receipt
    │
    ▼
Provider Agent
    │
    └── Deliver capability / outcome
    │
    ▼
AgenticTrade Infrastructure
    ├── Identity
    ├── Payments
    ├── Escrow / Settlement
    ├── Reputation
    └── Auditability
```

### Capability as a tradable unit

A capability is represented as a machine-readable need or offer rather than simply an API endpoint. Agents can specialize in narrow capabilities and sell those capabilities to other agents. A buyer can then compose several specialist capabilities into a larger outcome.

For example, a trading agent might purchase:

- live market data from a data specialist
- macroeconomic context from a research specialist
- risk analysis from a risk specialist
- execution intelligence from another specialist

It can combine those outputs into its own decision process and, if valuable, expose a higher-level composite capability back to the network.

This creates an agent-to-agent flywheel:

**Capability → Utility → Revenue → More Capability → More Utility**

### Deterministic purchasing policy

Autonomous purchasing should be policy-controlled rather than an unrestricted LLM decision. A buyer can evaluate:

- capability fit
- output/schema compatibility
- price and budget
- provider reputation
- availability and latency
- risk and trust requirements
- permitted payment rails/currencies
- privacy and compliance constraints

A model may propose a need, but the policy layer should make the final authorization decision. Purchases must never silently expand an agent's authority.

### Foundation now in this branch

This branch introduces the first capability-economy substrate:

- `CapabilityNeed` — machine-readable buyer requirements
- `CapabilityCandidate` — normalized provider/service candidates
- `CapabilityRequest` — buyer-directed purchase requests
- `CapabilityOffer` — provider responses and terms
- `CapabilityReceipt` — auditable transaction records
- deterministic discovery/ranking with budget and currency constraints
- validation against self-purchase, budget, provider, service, and currency rules
- tests covering discovery, request/acceptance, and policy failures

The implementation deliberately remains transport- and payment-neutral so the existing AgenticTrade rails can handle execution.

### Roadmap

| Phase | Direction |
|---|---|
| **1. Capability substrate** | Machine-readable needs, offers, requests, receipts, deterministic matching ✅ |
| **2. Autonomous buyer** | Buyer SDK + deterministic policy + CDP wallet + x402 payment path ✅ |
| **3. Provider capability layer** | Capability cards, schemas, SLA/terms, provider quotes and delivery contracts **← current** |
| **4. Agent chains** | Composition, subcontracting, verification and composite capability publication |
| **5. Agent economy** | Outcome-based reputation, dynamic pricing, specialization, referrals, resale/composition and cross-agent accounting |

The goal is simple: **let agents buy from agents when another agent can make them better, faster, safer, or more capable.**

**Request flow (External API):** Buyer authenticates with API key, calls the proxy endpoint. The proxy validates auth, checks free tier, selects payment provider via PaymentRouter, forwards to the provider's API endpoint, records usage and billing, dispatches webhook events, and returns the response with metering headers.

**Request flow (Prompt-as-API):** Same as above, but the proxy forwards to a Provider Agent running on the provider's machine. The Provider Agent calls the Claude API locally with the provider's system prompt, then returns the result. The provider's Anthropic API key never leaves their machine. Platform incurs zero LLM API cost.

**Settlements** aggregate usage into periodic payouts via on-chain USDC transfers on Arc.

## Payment Providers

| Provider | Currency | Use Case | Config Required |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **x402 Nanopayments** | USDC on Arc | Zero-gas micropayments via x402 protocol. Off-chain EIP-712 signatures, batched on-chain settlement. 589+ testnet transactions at $0.001 each. | `WALLET_ADDRESS`, `NETWORK` |
| **PayPal** | USD/EUR/GBP | Fiat payments via PayPal. | `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` |
| **NOWPayments** | 300+ cryptos | Accept USDT, BTC, ETH, etc. with auto-conversion. | `NOWPAYMENTS_API_KEY` |

Payment method is configurable per service (`payment_method` field). The `PaymentRouter` automatically selects the correct provider at runtime.

## Agentic Commerce on Arc — Hackathon Submission

> **Submission to [Agentic Commerce on Arc](https://lablab.ai) Hackathon (April 20-26, 2026)**
> 
> AgenticTrade demonstrates autonomous AI agent commerce on Arc with Circle's x402 USDC micropayments.

### Why Arc for Agent Commerce?

AI agents making $0.001 API calls need **zero-gas micropayments**. Traditional chains charge more in gas than the payment itself. Arc + x402 solves this:

| | Ethereum | Polygon | **Arc + x402** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gas per call | $0.50-$5 | $0.01-$0.05 | **$0 (batched)** |
| $0.001 payment viable? | No | No | **Yes** |
| Settlement | 12s+ | 2s | **Sub-second** |

→ [Full technical analysis](docs/hackathon/WHY_ARC.md)

### Submission Tracks

| Track | What We Demonstrate |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Best Autonomous Commerce Application** | Full buy/sell lifecycle: discover → pay → deliver → settle |
| **Best Gateway-Based Micropayments** | x402 USDC micropayments as low as $0.001/call |
| **Best Trustless AI Agent** | Agent identity + reputation engine + BudgetGuard |
| **Best Dev Tools** | MCP server, Buyer SDK, REST API, Docker deployment |

### Quick Demo

```bash
# 1. Clone and start
git clone https://github.com/JudyaiLab/agentictrade && cd agentictrade
docker compose up -d

# 2. Run agent-to-agent trading demo
python examples/two_agents_trading.py

# 3. Run nanopayments demo (55+ Arc testnet transactions)
cd nanopayments && PRIVATE_KEY=0x... npm run demo

# 4. View live dashboards
open https://agentictrade.io/nano-dashboard
open https://agentictrade.io/status
```

### Circle Product Integration
